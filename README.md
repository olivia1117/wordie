# wordie
A knockoff version of the game Wordle and written with Python

This program is designed to simulate the popular game of Wordle and alternatively
titled Wordie instead. Essentially, this program allows the user to guess what the five-letter word is
and they get 6 chances to accomplish this.
If they guess a letter correctly, then the it will be marked with an  

* - if it's in the right location or 
? - if the letter is right, but in the wrong location and
x - if the letter is not in the word
